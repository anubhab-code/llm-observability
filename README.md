# 🛰️ LLM Observability Pipeline

The **LLM Observability Pipeline** is an end-to-end monitoring and evaluation framework designed to provide **enterprise-grade observability** into Large Language Model (LLM) usage.  
It captures user interactions, enriches them with metadata, and exposes insights via an interactive **Streamlit-powered dashboard**.

This project bridges the gap between **data engineering** and **AI governance**, enabling teams to track **performance, cost, reliability, hallucinations, and user feedback** in a structured, auditable way.

## 🚀 Features

### 📊 Dashboard Features

The **LLM Observability Dashboard** provides real-time visibility into model performance, cost, and reliability.  
It consolidates structured logs into actionable insights for **data engineers, ML practitioners, and audit teams**.  

#### 1. 🔎 Prompt Search & Interaction Explorer
- Full-text search across prompts for incident investigation.  
- Enables targeted review of **specific interactions** that may have failed, hallucinated, or generated unexpected costs.  

#### 2. 🗂️ Prompt Category Distribution
- Visualizes workload segmentation by **functional categories** (e.g., Q&A, summarization, creative, technical).  
- Guides **optimization efforts** toward the most frequently used workloads.  

#### 3. ⏱️ Latency Analysis
- **Latency over time**: Detects systemic slowdowns, provider bottlenecks, or time-of-day effects.  
- **Latency distribution**: Identifies long-tail requests and outlier behaviors.  
- **Latency by category**: Surfaces workload types that systematically degrade performance.  

#### 4. 💰 Cost Monitoring
- **Cost over time**: Tracks operational expenses across workloads.  
- **Cost by provider**: Enables **procurement optimization** by comparing unit economics of different vendors.  

#### 5. 🔤 Token Utilization
- Distribution of tokens per request, with segmentation by success/hallucination.  
- Helps identify workloads that are **token-inefficient** and driving cost overhead.  

#### 6. ✅ Reliability Metrics
- **Success rate overall** and by provider/model.  
- **Error rate analysis** for comparative benchmarking of vendor APIs.  
- Enables **SLA (Service Level Agreement) compliance monitoring**.  

#### 7. 🧑‍💻 Feedback Analysis
- Aggregates user feedback signals for **quality monitoring**.  
- Cross-references feedback against hallucination rates for **governance insights**.  

#### 8. 🌀 Hallucination Analysis
- **Hallucination rate by model**: Benchmarks generative accuracy across providers/models.  
- **Hallucination rate by category**: Identifies high-risk workloads (e.g., technical answers vs. creative tasks).  
- **Temporal hallucination trends**: Detects **drift or regression** in model quality over time.  
- **Prompt complexity vs. hallucination**: Correlates linguistic complexity with factual reliability.  
- **Token usage in hallucinated responses**: Analyzes verbosity patterns in erroneous generations.  

#### 9. 🔗 Provider Benchmarking
- Joint view of **success rate vs. hallucination rate per provider**.  
- Informs **vendor selection, procurement strategy, and reliability assessments**.  

#### 10. 📈 Advanced Similarity Metrics *(Optional)*
- Prompt-response **semantic similarity scoring** (if enabled).  
- Low similarity values flag **off-topic or incoherent outputs**.  
- Supports **automated hallucination detection pipelines**.

## 🛠️ Industry Relevance

This dashboard adheres to **enterprise observability standards** by:  
- Capturing **structured logs** for reproducibility and auditability.  
- Supporting **performance/cost/reliability benchmarking** across providers.  
- Incorporating **AI-specific governance metrics** (hallucination, feedback correlation).  
- Enabling **continuous monitoring** for data drift, vendor reliability, and model ROI.  

By integrating these observability practices, the pipeline can be positioned as a **production-ready monitoring solution** for generative AI deployments.
